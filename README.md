# Popular Movies

Here is a functional android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program.

## Features

* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Save favorite movies locally
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews

## Future Improvements

* Improve user interface using Material Design
* Add endless scroll to be able to load more movies.
* Add ButterKnife for cleaner code
* Integrate Retrofit to the request that currently don't use it

## Requirements

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to:
    ```
    app/build.gradle
    ```


## Libraries

* [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
